To ensure efficient code management and smooth collaboration, please follow these basic rules:

1. **Commit Guidelines**: After making any changes to the code, always commit with a clear and concise message describing the changes. The commit message should be brief yet informative, helping other team members understand the purpose of the update.
2. **Branch Management**: Before starting any feature development or bug fix, please create a new branch from the `main` or `develop` branch. Avoid committing directly to the `main` branch. Once your work is done, submit a pull request for code review.
3. **Code Review**: Before merging, the submitted code must be reviewed by at least one team member. Only after approval should the code be merged into the main branch.
4. **Avoid Committing Invalid Code**: Please commit your progress regularly, but avoid committing code that is incomplete or non-functional. Ensure the code is in a working state and does not break the build.
